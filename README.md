# introtoAI
During my Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course, I explored fundamental AI concepts, including search algorithms, machine learning, probabilistic reasoning, and neural networks. The course provided hands-on experience with implementing AI models and solving real-world problems using various algorithms. I worked extensively with Python, leveraging libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch to develop and evaluate AI models. Through projects, I gained experience in supervised and unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and heuristic-based problem-solving, enhancing my understanding of how AI techniques are applied in diverse domains.
